# MPU6050 Introduction
- 6 DOF = 3-axis MEMS Accelerometer + 3-axis MEMS Gyroscope
- MEMS -> Micro Electro Mechanical System
- Onboard Digital Motion Processor (DMP) capable of processing complex 9-axis sensor fusion algorithms
- Operates at 16 bit ADC
- Communicates with registers using I<sup>2</sup>C Interface
- Registers -> important component of digital devices that stores data and instructions for quick processing
- Power supply voltage range of 2.375V to 3.46V
- Inbuilt 3.3V regulator so can also work with 5V logic
- Digital-output X-, Y-, and Z-Axis angular rate sensors (gyroscopes) with a user-programmable fullscale range of ±250, ±500, ±1000, and ±2000°/sec
- Digital-output triple-axis accelerometer with a programmable full scale range of ±2g, ±4g, ±8g and ±16g

## I<sup>2</sup>C Interface
- Two-wire interface comprised of the signals - serial data (SDA) and serial clock (SCL)
- Lines are open-drain and bi-directional
- MPU6050 supports two different I<sup>2</sup>C addresses - 0x68 and 0x69 (HEX)
- ADO is LOW or unconnected => 0x68
- ADO is HIGH or connected to 3.3V => 0x69
